* What does this thing do?
This is a chrome extension that swaps youtube videos.  For whatever
reason, some youtube videos on the 6.002x course website are not
working.  This code tries to swap out bad videos for good videos,
that's it.


How to install?

- Download the code. unzip it if necessary and rename the directory: 6002x-hack

- enter the following text into the URL bar:  

chrome://extensions/

- select "developer mode" switch in the upper right corner

- click the "load unpacked" button

- select the directory 6002x-hack

that should be all there is to it.

----

How to tell the extensions is loaded?  A small icon with the number 6
should be among the extension icons in the upper right corner of the
chrome browser window.
